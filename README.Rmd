kaps is a multi-way partitioning algorithm, which divides the data into $K$ heterogeneous subgroups based on the information from a prognostic factor. 
Such a multi-way partition is found by maximizing the minimum of the subgroup pairwise test statistics.
An optimal number of subgroups is determined by a permutation test. 


You can install:

* the latest released version from CRAN with

    ```R
    install.packages("dplyr")
    ````

* the latest development version from github with

    ```R
    if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
      install.packages("devtools")
    }
    devtools::install_github("sooheang/kaps")
    ```
