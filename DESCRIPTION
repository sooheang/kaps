Authors@R: c(person(given = "Soo-Heang", family = "Eo", role = c("aut","cre"), 
	email = "eo.sooheang@gmail.com"),
			person(given = "Seung-Mo", family = "Hong", role = "ctb"),

Description: Multi-way partitioning algorithms are implemented, which divides the data into K heterogeneous subgroups based on the information from a prognostic factor. The resulting subgroups show significant differences in survival. For more details, see Eo et al. (2013) <arXiv:1306.4615>.
